                        \n # Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The
                        \n codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between
                        \n 1 and 6.
                        \n # The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the
                        \n codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty
                        \n spaces.
                        \n # A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code
                        \n and in the same position. For example:
                        \n Secret number - 1234
                        \n Input number - 6264
                        \n Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position
                        \n # A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code
                        \n but in a different position. For example:
                        \n Secret number - 1234
                        \n Input number - 6462
                        \n Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)
                        \n # An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.
                        \n # If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent -
                        \n codebreaker loses.
                        \n # Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a
                        \n separate digit of the secret code.\n"
